# threedee
A largely pointless, possibly useless, but hopefully educational and maybe entertaining collection of 3d-related math-y things

## 3d-related things

I want to play around with coordinate systems, projection, matrix math and things like that.

## Secondary

### Rust

Just because I want to play with it.

### GitHub

There will be experiments with GH functionality, especially Actions too.
